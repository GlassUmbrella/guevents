guevents - knockout event handlers which disable buttons until promises have completed

# Docs
Swap knockout `click` and `submit` binding handlers for `guclick` and `gusubmit`. As long as the bound methods return promises, buttons will be auto disabled until the promise completes.


# Install
`bower install mrvalidate --save`
